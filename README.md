Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

Edit the .env file and configure the necessary variables:

| Variable               | Description                                     | Example Value                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DATABASE_URL`         | PostgreSQL connection string                    | `postgresql://user:password@host:port/db?schema=public`        |
| `JWT_SECRET`             | Secure secret string for signing JWT tokens      | `YOUR_SECURE_JWT_SECRET`                                     |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`       | Google Cloud Client ID for OAuth 2.0              | `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`                                      |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`   | Google Cloud Client Secret                        | `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`                                  |
| `SERVER_URL`             | Base URL of your backend                          | `http://localhost:5000`                                      |
| `CLIENT_URL`             | Base URL of your frontend (for CORS/redirects)  | `http://localhost:5173`                                      |

### Install Dependencies

From the root project folder (AppointMe/), run:

npm install

This will install dependencies for the root, backend, and frontend.

### Set up Database

Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and you have created the database specified in DATABASE_URL.

From the root folder, run the initial Prisma migration:

npm run prisma:migrate

(This script runs npm run prisma:migrate -w backend).

## üíª Usage (Development)

To start the backend and frontend development servers concurrently:

From the root project folder (AppointMe/), run:

npm run dev

This command uses `concurrently` to launch the development scripts defined in the `package.json` files of the `backend` and `frontend` workspaces.

Now you can access the app in your browser:

*   Frontend (Client): Typically at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port).
*   Backend API: Typically at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).
